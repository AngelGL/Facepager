<h1 class="first">Getting started</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Click &quot;New Database&quot; in the toolbar to create a blank database</li>
    <li>Add Facebook IDs by clicking &quot;Add Nodes&quot; in the toolbar. Enter the last part of a Facebook page, e.g. enter &quot;Tatort&quot; for the page &quot;http://www.Facebook.com/Tatort&quot;. Alternatively you can enter "me" as reference to yourself.</li>
    <li>Select the Facebook tab and set Query to "&lt;self&gt;"</li>   
    <li>In the Facebook tab click on "Login to Facebook" and login to get a valid access token. Notice: the access token is like a password to Facebook. Since it may be printed in the status log and saved in the application settings don't give anyone untrusted access to your computer or to the status log.</li>    
    <li>Select one or more nodes in the view and click &quot;Fetch data&quot;.</li> 
    <li>Click "Expand nodes" in the toolbar and select one of the new child nodes. The raw data is shown to the right.</li>
    <li>Change the column setup according to your needs by adding keys found in the raw data into the "Custom Table Columns" area. Don't forget to click "Apply Column Setup".</li>  
</ol>

<h1>Overview of the Facepager-Layout</h1>
<img src="facepager_overview_annotated.png" />



	<ul>
		<li><b>Object View:</b>
			This view includes the objects of your data collection (Facebook
			posts, Statuses or Twitter Tweets and
			any other objects that an API is able to return. 
			<br>
			These objects have different attributes, which are displayed in the columns of the
			object view and may differ between different types or classes of
			objects (only the first four columns do not change, because they are crucial througout the whole data collection
			process) and usually one object is one row. 
			<br>
			Objects may include objects (they may be nested): A Facebook-post may have comments related to
			that post. When you request the comments for a post and a result is
			returned, these comments are automatically inserted under the post
			as single rows.You´ll notice - depending on your operating system - an arrow or
			plus sign besides the objects. Clicking it, will unfold the object
			show the related or "child"-objects. Of course, objects may have
			multiple levels or relationships.
			</li>
		<li><b>Query Window:</b> The starting point for fetching data from an
			API.Preconfigured comes a tab for requesting data from Facebook, Twitter
			and a "Generic"-Tab, which enables you to get data from most JSON-based
			API (this is for the advanced usecases only).
			<br>
			Crawling data from Facebook and Twitter requires a <b>Login</b>
			with your user credentials. Before starting your data collection
			process, you should complete the login via the corresponding
			buttons. A login-windows will open and once the login is
			successful, collecting the data is possible <i>(NOTE: Your user credentials
			are stored locally, i.e. no personal data is submitted to the
			developers or any other authority)</i>.
		</li>
		<li><b>Status View:</b> This window is for logging and debugging
		purposes only. Messages issued here may inform you about the details of
		the data collection process or any other errors while fetching data.
		</li>
		<li><b>Data & Column View:</b> This viewport includes two components:
		The <b>Raw Data View</b> shows the unparsed, raw JSON-Data of the selected
			object or row in the <b>Object View</b>.This data is displayed in
			the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation">JSON-Notation</a>,
			which follows a quite simple logic of a "key":"value" -
			notation <i>(NOTE: Most API´s return JSON-wrapped data)</i>i
			<br>
			While not all of the information in the raw data may be displayed in the
			<b>Object View</b> as a single column, one can control the column
			layout of the Object View via the <b>Custom Table Column</b>-Field:<br>
			Each line in this field controls the columns in the Object View (and
			the csv-export as well) and corresponds to a "key" in the
			Raw-Data-View.For example, if you do not want to display the message
			of a Facebook-post, simply delete "message" from the Custom-Table
			and click "Apply" (vice versa,add a key in the raw data to add a
			column).
			<br>
			If there are nested key:value pairs in the raw data (f.e.
		    {"user":{"name":"Facepager"}}, you can pass these nested keys
			seperated by a dot (user.name) to the column setup, to display the
			value ("Facepager").
		</li>
	</ul>

<h1>Getting data from the Facebook-API</h1>

<p>
        The "Query" parameter denotes the object or entity you want to fetch
		from Facebook. When you entered the name of a Facebook-Page via "Add
		Node", the "Query"-field should contain  "&lt;self&gt;". 
        This means that the ID of this starting point (i.e. it`s name) is fetched from Facebook.
        Enter your own Facebook-Name or simply a "me", and the tool fetches your own Facebook-Profile (you must gain access to your own via "Login to Facebook"). 
        As you can see, the "Raw Data" window on the right side contains the raw information:
</p>

<img src="facebook_rawdata.PNG" alt="Raw Data View" />

<p>
        This data is formatted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation">JSON-Notation</a>, which follows a quite simple logic of key:value pair. 
        One could state that keys relate to columns in an Excel-Sheet, while values are the row-values in that column. 
        On Facebook <b>every</b> object has a fixed ID. This ID is shown in the column "Object ID" in the main window and is the starting point for all queries to the Facebook-API. 
        For example, if you want to get all of your friends on Facebook, select the "me" node, change the "Query"-parameter to "friends" and click on "Fetch Data". 
        As you can see from the Status-Log Window, a requests against the Facebook-API is done, containing both your own id and the queryparameter: <i>https://graph.Facebook.com/1346277685/friends </i> 
</p>
    
    
    <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Base URL</th>
        <th>Object ID</th>
        <th>Query Parameter</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>  
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td> https://graph.Facebook.com </td>
        <td> 1346277685 </td>
        <td> friends </td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>

<br>

<p>
The results of this request are shown in the main window. As you can see, the friends are automatically nested under the row of the current user ("me").
This is a central concept: Every request is issued against a specific object (User, post, comments and so on) and it's object id. 
The tool chooses the ID automatically, based an the currently clicked or activated row in the main view.If multiple rows/objects are selected (via SHIFT), requests for each row are issued.

<p>
For more information on Facebook-Objects and the underlying system (and the
interpretation of the raw-data), see the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook API documentation </a>. 
Information regarding the offset and limit parameter in detail, consider <a
	href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/pagination/"> this </a> documentation. 
A quick explanation:

    <ul> 
        <li><b>Offset: </b> 
            Imagine you want to fetch 500 comments for a Facebook-post and the limit is set to "50". Thus, there are 10 "pages" of information available, each containing 50 comments. 
            With the offset-parameter, you can cycle or paginate through these pages, i.e. an offset=51 would return the comments 51-100, offset=101 the comments 101-150 and so on 
            (Info: comments are usually ordered by their date). If you want to get all 500 comments, you habe to rreadjust the offse-parameter 10 times and do 10 requests in this case 
            (offset=[0,51,101,151,201,251,301,351,401,451])  
         </li>
        <li><b>Limit: </b> 
            This is the number of individual objects that are returned in page. The maximum is usually 500
        </li>
        <li><b>Since: </b> 
            A date, f.e. denoting the objects creation time. In the above example, since="14.07.2013" would grab comments made after the 13.07.2013. 
            Not every Facebook-Object has a timestamp and therefore a limit, f.e. the users friends (in this case, the "since"-paramter has no effect)
        </li>
        <li><b>Until: </b> 
            A date, f.e. denoting the objects creation time. In the above example, until="17.07.2013" would grab comments made before the 17.07.2013. 
            Not every Facebook-Object has a timestamp and therefore a limit, f.e. the users friends (in this case, the "until"-paramter has no effect). 
            A combination of "since" and "until" is possible.
        </li>
    </ul>
