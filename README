Facebook-Page Scraper-GUI-Tool

Facepager was made for fetching public available data from Facebook. All data is stored in a SQLite database and may be exported to Excel. 

Version 2.0 features:
-Fetch data for multiple facebook objects at once
-Choose which relational data (comments, likes etc.) to download
-Customize columns in user interface and exported files

Version 2.1 features:
-Search facebook
-Export to CSV instead of XLS, which is faster
-Minor bug fixes

    
Notice: Database files may be incompatible between different versions.
                                                      
You should be aware that downloading large amounts of data may result in errors.

Getting started:

1. Run Facepager
2. Click "New Database" in the toolbar to create a blank database
3. Add Facebook IDs by clicking "Add Nodes" in the toolbar. Enter the last part of a Facebook page, e.g. enter "Tatort" for the page "http://www.facebook.com/Tatort"
4. Select one or more nodes in the view and click "Fetch data".  


Todo:
-Improve user experience and speed
-Log all queries
-Manage nodes (extended select, delete, sort, find...)
-Better source code documentation
