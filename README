Facebook-Page Scraper-GUI-Tool

Facepager was made for scraping Facebook-Pages, which are public available, over larger timespans. Contentual as well as structural Informations like the Type of content, links,
the count of comments are stored in a visualized SQL Database. A export to CSV-Files is currently developed.

Facepager saves the following Informations from Facebook Pages (adding more in the future):

It is possible to define the timespan via a simple interface, but you should be aware that large timespans may results in errors, depending of the amount of interactions, posts
etc.


Agenda for the future:

-Improve the Speed in general
-Save photos, albums and other stuff
-Export options
-Options/Checkbox to select, which informations should be stored, which not
