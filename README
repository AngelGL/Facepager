Facebook-Page Scraper-GUI-Tool

Facepager was made for fetching public available data from Facebook. All data is stored in a SQLite database and may be exported to Excel. 

This version supports:

-Fetching data for multiple facebook objects at once
-Choosing which relational data (comments, likes etc.) to download
-Customizing columns in user interface and exported files    
                                                      
You should be aware that downloading large amounts of data may result in errors.

Getting started:

1. Run Facepager
2. Click "New Database" in the toolbar to create a blank database
3. Add Facebook IDs by clicking "Add Nodes" in the toolbar. Enter the last part of a Facebook page, e.g. enter "Tatort" for the page "http://www.facebook.com/Tatort"
4. Select one or more nodes in the view and click "Fetch data".  


Todo:
-Improve user experience and speed
-Log all queries
-Store multiple queries for one object (monitoring over time)
-Better source code documentation
